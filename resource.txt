/public folder was generated by gatsby when we ran gatsby develop. Here it contains all stuff that is been served to the browser when we preview it.
It will be the folder that we deploy to server after we run our build command.
All stuffs will go to public folder.

In case while moving pages file you may get some error in browser either refresh page or restart  the process(ctrl+c then run develop again).
